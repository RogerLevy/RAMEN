## Introduction

Ramen (Really Accessible Multimedia Engine) is a 2D game engine written in Forth.

Ramen is built on [AllegroForthKit](https://rogerlevy.github.io/afkit/).

Ramen is divided into core modules and optional libraries.  (The words "module" and "library" are used interchangeably, but only in the sense that a library is a kind of module.)
