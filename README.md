# Introduction

Ramen is a 2D game engine written in Forth.

Ramen is built on [AllegroForthKit](https://rogerlevy.github.io/afkit/) and consists of several core modules and optional libraries. \(The words "module" and "library" are used interchangeably, but only in the sense that a library is a kind of module.\)

There is a standard collection of libraries, called the Standard Packet. It includes Tiled support and animated sprite support and will be suited to most 2D games.
