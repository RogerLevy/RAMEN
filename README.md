Ramen is a 2D game engine written in Forth, built on [AllegroForthKit](https://rogerlevy.github.io/afkit/).  

Ramen is a modular engine that consists of several core modules and is intended to be extended.  It comes with several libraries for this purpose.  A standard collection of libraries, called the Standard Packet, brings together the most generally useful features, including Tiled map and animated sprite support and can be used to make a variety of 2D games.
